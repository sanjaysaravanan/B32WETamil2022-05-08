Recap: Last Session

Topics:

  Hooks -> 
    Functional component is purely representational and stateless.

  Hooks got introduced in 16.8 to overcome the functional component state/lifecycle handling.
  by creating communication between the DOM and fucntional component
  eg: useState, useEffect

  Counter Component --> A Simple Component with State Count has increment and decrement funcs

  Passing Data from Child to Parent ---> with the help callback function passed a props to child we can pass data from child to parent during action/event

  Props Drilling ---> Passing data as props from 
  Top-Ancestor --> Grand-Parent --> Parent --> Child ........
  Disadvantage:
    passing data from Child to Parent/Top-Ancestor becomes tideous process

  Reusable Component with Dynamic Data to Component
    1. Write a Reusable component  ---> See the Reuired Props and Write a componet
    2. Data Passing between components ---> Using Callback function and Props we can modify the data of parent from one component and pass the data to other component.
